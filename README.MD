# Badaboum 

Badaboum was written for an STM32F10 project to control a quadcopter using a XBOX 360 controller.

# Last Working State
The quadcopter was able to hovers at very low height. The stability was quite poor as was the directional control.

# Files and Folders
The Project directory contains code for the initialization and calibration of the gyroscope and accelerometers. 
I suppose it includes code for controlling the LCD and the motors on the quadcopter. Nonetheless, this code is 
pretty much useless but, as a first project relic, it has it's place.
